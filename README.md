## 🎯 Design Goals

**Target Player Feeling**: "Tactile chaos under control"
- Every input, upgrade, and projectile should feel satisfying and legible
- Session length: <5 minutes per level
- ~15 level-ups per run
- Immediate action with minimal onboarding friction

**Key Improvements Over Genre Conventions**
1. **Simplified Input** - Continuous drag, no finger-lift absorb mechanic
2. **Visual Clarity** - Clear enemy types, readable projectiles, better feedback
3. **Character-Based Gacha** - Ships/pilots instead of gear for immediate impact
4. **Expanded Camera View** - Better visibility and dodging space
5. **Weapon Feel** - Unique audio, visual, and physical identity per weapon
6. **Early Co-op Access** - Social features from first session
